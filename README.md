# Movie DB

### Overview
Movie DB is powered by a backend API movies database. Movies or series can be searched for and the API returns a response otherwise an error message is displayed. To get more information about the searched movie/series, a single page is provided which can be linked to by clicking the movie/series poster. 

React Context API is used to manage the state with react-router-dom being used to manage page navigation.
